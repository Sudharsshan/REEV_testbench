# REEV_testbench
This repo contains a flutter linux app supporting linux installation and python integration to run on _Raspberry Pi 5_

## Info
---
- this flutter app is built to run natively on Linux with websocket based communication at dedicated port from python backend
- it uses websocket to communicate the python backend with flutter engine to show on the frontend **realtime!!**

- The complete authority of this magic rests in the hand of a wizard called Dr. Strange who dwells within the universe of Pi
- He monitors and controls the execution of the magic to ensure his subject's wellbeings (that's us!) by monitoring the following aspects:
1. **Status of system** - charging / discharging
2. **Voltage** of system
3. **Current** flowing through the system
4. **RPM** of the system's engine
5. **Relays** to do the switching!
6. **MOSFETS** to cast a spell in reducing the start current of heavy motors and keep them safe while starting
